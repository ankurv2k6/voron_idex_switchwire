# voron_idex_switchwire
IDEX version of Voron SwitchWire CoreXZ 3d printer

This IDEX SW is based on an Ender3 pro conversion to a Voron SW - the base conversion mod used is the one here:

 https://github.com/boubounokefalos/Ender_SW
 
 Many thanks to @boubounokefalos for this excellent mod
 
 Major changes to the mod include:
 
    * Extension of the X axis to 400mm to accomodate the dual toolheads
    * Extension of the Ender3 frame to accomodate the larger X axis
    * 9mm Y axis based on 2 mgn12 linear rails to provide stability to the 300mm bed - this is not needed if you want to keep the build size the same as the original ender3 pro.


Extra components required
    * 2 extra stepper motors for dual Z axis
    * 1 extra toolhead with all its associaated components
    
    
Extra printed parts (in addition to the parts from https://github.com/boubounokefalos/Ender_SW)

* Printed parts from this repository in the STL folder

* Additional parts from the orginal Ender_SW repository:
         * Additional Upper Idlers left and right
         * Additional Motor mounts left and right for the Z motors (x_motor_mount and z_motor_mount)


The belt routing that will be followed is the dual markforged kinematics. I will get a video or diagram up shortly explaining this.
